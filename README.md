I made a website naming ‘Explore Pakistan’. It will be a tourism website 
having a main page as well as separate landing pages for each province of Pakistan.
Main page will include top destinations, discounts, block diagrams, pictures and client 
reviews. Initially we will be adding major tourist attractions and historic places. 
Eating places, nearby hotels and maps will also be provided with each landmark 
mentioned per province. We will be using HTML, CSS and java script to develop our 
website
