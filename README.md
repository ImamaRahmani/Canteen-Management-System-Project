**Description
and 
Working:**


I made a website naming ‘Explore Pakistan’. It will be a tourism website 
having a main page as well as separate landing pages for each province of Pakistan.
Main page will include top destinations, discounts, block diagrams, pictures and client 
reviews. Initially we will be adding major tourist attractions and historic places. 
Eating places, nearby hotels and maps will also be provided with each landmark 
mentioned per province. We will be using HTML, CSS and java script to develop our 
website


**Motivation:**

Stepping in the 21st century, where everything is a touch away, our group decided to 
take it as an opportunity and create something different which will ease the tourists 
with finding a perfect destination for their holidays just by opening our website and 
entering the province the want to explore! This will appeal our modern-day costumers 
as they do not want to hassle when searching for a perfect destination in the outskirts, 
another city or province. Such initiatives will promote the tourism industry of 
Pakistan. In future, we can also convert our website into an application
